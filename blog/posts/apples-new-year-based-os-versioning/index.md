At this year’s WWDC, Apple announced that they are [changing all versions of their different operating systems to be the number 26](https://www.simplymac.com/ios/apple-ditching-number-naming-for-their-os-releases-will-now-be-using-the-year). As they mentioned, this is based on the year that they will be in service for longest and is inteded to unify the version numbers between all platforms.

As such, this year’s OS releases will include:

-   iOS 26
-   iPadOS 26
-   macOS 26
-   watchOS 26
-   tvOS 26
-   visionOS 26

For anyone following tech news, this won’t be new. As a long-time Apple user, I do, however, have a few things to say about it.

My feelings are mixed. I’m the type of person that needs order. Call me slightly autistic or OCD, but I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the fact that Apple has mostly been consistent with its versioning when it comes to its software. I do wish they had stopped with the Mac OS X 10.x nonsense sooner and moved on to Mac OS 11, but at least it was still in sequence.

Contrast that to Microsoft’s chaotic and nonsensical versioning system for Windows. I realize that, internally, Windows NT is still versioned sequentially, but you don’t see that anywhere unless you know where to look.

As such, I am a bit dismayed that Apple made such a huge leap in version numbers.

That said though, I understand why. It makes absolute sense to unify the versions across their multiple platforms so that both consumers and developers know which feature set to expect. Since Apple already indicates Mac models by the year they were released, this makes sense to do on the software-side as well. Now, they just need to carry this over to their iPads, iPhones, Apple Watches, etc.

Ubuntu has been using a YEAR.MONTH versioning scheme for their OS releases from the beginning. This has never bothered me because it was logical and sequential.

It will take me a little bit of time to get used to Apple’s new versioning, but as long as they stay consisent and avoid Microsoft’s versioning follies, I think it’s for the better. In the end, it’s just a number that indicates a specfic release of a piece of software and version numbers don’t really matter. They are just labels to identfy a specific piece of software.
