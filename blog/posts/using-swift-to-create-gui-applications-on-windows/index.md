I came across an article on [InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com) today that discussed efforts being made by the development team at The Browser Company (makers of the experimental Arc browser) to create an open-source technology to make UI development in Swift on Windows possible.

The intention is to create a “bridge” that will easily allow Swift developers to bring a macOS or iOS application to Windows using the native WinUI framework. Development is still in its early stages, so it will be interesting to see how it progresses and whether or not it will be abandoned like other similar projects have in the past.

The project and a little bit of its history are described very well in the [article on InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3709855/using-swift-with-winui-on-windows.html), so I can only recommend you read through it if the topic interests you.
