Mozilla has recently had a lot of blowback about several recent changes they’ve made to Firefox. They have introduced a Terms of Service and have updated their privacy policy to include vague language about data collection. I won’t go into detail here though, so if you don’t know what’s going on, this is a great summary:

<figure><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="I'm ditching Firefox &amp; Mozilla after 10 years of blunders" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rc96ISKh2OM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc96ISKh2OM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch the video on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>

As a reaction to this video, however, Ryan Sipes, a member of the Thunderbird team, went on video to clarify what the situation is. This video is definitely worth watching if you are interested in what is going on:

I tend to give Mozilla the benefit of the doubt in this situation. They were quick to react to the feedback they received and since they are such a prominent name in the open source community, their every move will be continued to be heavily scrutinized online which I’m absolutely certain they are aware of.
