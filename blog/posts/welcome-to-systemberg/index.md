Welcome to Systemberg! This website is a new blog that I, [Alex Seifert](https://www.alexseifert.com), have started to serve as a place where I can create less formal posts about current affairs in the mainstream media or about technology than you would usually find on [my other blogs](https://www.systemberg.com/other-blogs/). As such, you’ll find the design itself is quite different in that it is a much more traditional blog design without much emphasis on images.

Hopefully, you’ll find it interesting and informative, even if you disagree with some of my views on what is going on.

All posts earlier than this one are imported from my personal blog, [Alex’s Notebook](https://blog.alexseifert.com), and were added to add some additional content that I thought would fit this blog.
