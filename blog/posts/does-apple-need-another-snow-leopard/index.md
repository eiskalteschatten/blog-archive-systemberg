This is a post that will most certainly betray my age in that I fondly remember the release of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard. The previous year’s release, 10.5 Leopard, was a significant upgrade in visuals and features after 10.4 Tiger’s many years of service. Unfortunately, with large upgrades come large amounts of bugs. While I can’t remember Leopard being unstable, I do remember that Snow Leopard made the system feel much more stable and polished which was exactly the point of the release. No new features, just more stability.

That said, [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/14/apple-needs-snow-leopard-software/) raises the question as to whether another Snow Leopard-like release is something that the Apple community needs:

> The last few days have been very busy when it comes to Apple news. That’s because the company has confirmed that the new Siri experience has been delayed while sources suggest that the new features promised at last year’s WWDC won’t be ready any time soon. Given everything that’s going on at Apple recently, there’s one thing that could really help: another Snow Leopard.

Frankly, I think we are definitely lacking a good stability release. As someone who relies on their Macs, iPhone and iPad every single day for work and play, it is crucial to me that the operating system and its accompanying software be as unproblematic and stable as possible.
