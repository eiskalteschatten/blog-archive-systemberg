At this point, I’ve kept at least one blog for about twenty years. There have been times when I’ve kept several at once and others when I’ve kept only one or two. The itch to create new blogs means I am constantly doing so. This one is no exception.

With that said, let me introduce it.

Systemberg is a blog that I, [Alex Seifert](https://www.alexseifert.com/), will use to post commentary about whatever he finds that catches my interest. Sometimes, the posts are political in nature and other times they are about technology. Most of the time there will be a mix.

You can subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://www.systemberg.com/feed) or find me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@alexseifert) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/alex-seifert.bsky.social).

If you are looking for more in-depth posts about technology, you can find that on my personal blog, [Alex’s Notebook](https://blog.alexseifert.com/).

You can find more information about me on [my online portfolio](https://www.alexseifert.com/). I also write for other blogs which can be found [here](https://www.systemberg.com/other-blogs/).
