I finally did the deed and signed up for an account on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@alexseifert). I hesitated for a long time because I’m not a huge fan of their propriety nature, but I figure the more reach I have for my writing, the better.

I’ll mostly be (re-)posting articles I write for [Developer’s Notebook](https://www.developers-notebook.com/) and [The Beskirted Man](https://www.the-beskirted-man.com/), but may also include a few from [History Rhymes](https://www.historyrhymes.info/) and this blog.

If you have a Medium account and would like to follow me, you can find my account here:
