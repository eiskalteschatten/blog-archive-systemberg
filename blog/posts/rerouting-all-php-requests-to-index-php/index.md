A common need for a lot of PHP applications is the ability to have the entire application run through an index.php file, but with clean URLs. While this post wonâ€™t go into how to do that or why you would want to, it will provide the configuration for Apache that will allow you to do it:

```apacheconf
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    # Redirect /index.php to / (optional, but recommended I guess)
    RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} ^[A-Z]{3,9}\ /.*index\.php
    RewriteRule ^index.php/?(.*)$ $1 [R=301,L]

    # Run everything else but real files through index.php
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1?%{QUERY_STRING} [L]
</IfModule>
```

This can either go into the .htaccess file at the root of your project or in the virtual host configuration file.
