  "excerpt": "I previously discussed how to emulate Mac OS 8 and 9 on modern computers. Recently, I was shown Infinite Mac, a website that allows emulation of these and earlier Mac OS versions directly in your browser. From System 1.0 to Mac OS 9.2.2, most major releases are available. This suite offers a convenient and innovative way to experience classic Mac OS without downloads or installations.\n",
