Dolphin is also in that category of cross-platform KDE apps, though the Windows version is more of an experimental project. You have to [download the latest daily version](https://cdn.kde.org/ci-builds/system/dolphin/master/windows/) from KDE’s build server. After installation, Dolphin is available in the Start menu.

The title already says it all: It’s weird.

That said, Dolphin also offers a number of features that File Explorer doesn’t such as split screen views and the ability to start a terminal session from any folder. The latter may not be as relevant for Windows as it is for Linux, but it’s still convenient for power users.
