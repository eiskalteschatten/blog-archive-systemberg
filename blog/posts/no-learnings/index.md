[This](https://nolearnings.com/) can speak for itself:

> The word is *lessons*
> ---------------------
> 
> ### Here’s the scoop
> 
> Using separate language allows for separate behavior.
> 
> When a person speaks a corporate language instead of regular-person language, they behave in corporate ways instead of regular-person ways.
> 
> Which means they’d do things and accept things as a corporate person that regular-person they would not accept.
> 
> ### Here’s the request
> 
> Stop contributing to this system! Use the word *lessons* instead of *learnings*.
> 
> #### P.S.
> 
> *Learnings* makes you sound like a damn clown. Even if everybody says it — they all sound like clowns.

I don’t know how many times I’ve advocated for people to *finally* drop the “learnings” crap. I’ve hated it since day one, but have had to listen to it for years. I just wish I had had the idea to create a website like this. Someone else did it, though, and that makes me happy.
